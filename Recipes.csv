"Buttermilk Lavender Scones","2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar, 2 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 2 teaspoons dried culinary lavender, 2 teaspoons lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter (frozen), 1/2 cup (120ml) buttermilk, 1 large egg, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract","1: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, lavender, lemon zest, and salt together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. See video and photo above for a closer look at the texture. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together. 2: Whisk 1/2 cup buttermilk, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, then mix together until everything appears moistened. 3: To make triangle scones: Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1 more Tablespoon buttermilk. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges. For smaller scones, press dough into two 5-inch discs and cut each into 8 wedges. To make 10-12 drop scones: Keep mixing dough in the bowl until it comes together. Drop scones, about 1/4 cup of dough each, 3 inches apart on a lined baking sheet. 4: Brush scones with remaining buttermilk and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.) 5: Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). 6: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat(s). If making mini or drop scones, use 2 baking sheets. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s). 7: Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Larger scones take closer to 25 minutes. (Tip: I like to start the icing while the scones cook so the milk has a chance to steep.) Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before icing." 
"Mac and Cheese","3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons flour, 1 12oz canned evaporated milk, 1 cup half and half ( 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk), 1 tablespoon onion powder, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 teaspoon creole seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese (grated), 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese (grated), 1/2 cup jack cheese, Salt and pepper to taste, 8 ounce uncooked Macaroni","1: Add butter to skillet, as soon as butter melts whisk in flour. Continue whisking until flour is fully mixed with butter. Then cook for about a minute to get rid of the flour taste. 2: Slowly add evaporated milk a little at the time, followed by the half and half ; you do not want the mixture to form any lumps. Simmer for about 3-5 minutes until mixture thickens slightly. 3: Add seasonings, onion and garlic powder, creole seasoning and cayenne pepper. 4: Bring to a simmer and let it simmer gently for about 2 minutes. 5: Stir in the cheeses (reserve some as toppings later), and continue stirring until everything’s melted and evenly combined and smooth. Salt & pepper, to taste. 6: Add the cooked  pasta to the pot, stir to evenly incorporate. Transfer the pasta mixture into a the pan or into a lightly greased 2-qt. baking dish; top with remaining cheese. 7: Bake at 375 Degrees F° for 20 minutes or until golden and bubbly."

"Spicy Lentil Soup","2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, 1 medium yellow onion (diced), 1 large celery rib (diced), 1 large carrot (diced), 4 large garlic cloves (minced), 1 large baking potato (peeled and chopped into 1/2 inch pieces), 1.5 cups red lentils, 2 quarts vegetable broth, 2 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, 1/2 teaspoon ancho chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper,  1/4 teaspoon turmeric, 2 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice","1: Heat a large saucepan or small stockpot over medium to medium-high heat. Once hot, add the oil. When oil starts to shimmer, stir in the onion, celery, and carrot. Cook for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in garlic and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Add the potato, lentils, and vegetable broth. Turn up heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Then turn heat down to medium-low and stir in cumin, ancho chili powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and turmeric. Cover and simmer until all the vegetables are very tender, about 40 to 50 minutes. 2: Using an immersion blender, carefully puree the soup right in the pot, until no chunks of vegetables remain.
